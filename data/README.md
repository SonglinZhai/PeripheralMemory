## Preparing the data
1. Extract `ZsRE` and `CounterFact` from these two zips and place them in the current directory.
2. Make sure these two datasets are named `zsre_edit.json` and `counterfact_edit.json`.
3. Make sure this directory is organized as
   ```
   data
     | zsre_edit.json
     | counterfact_edit.json
   ```
